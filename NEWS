======================
1.12.2 - July 31, 2022
======================

- Fix the build when using CMake to configure it.

======================
1.12.1 - July 31, 2022
======================

- Fix pasteboard to use the generic interface by default.
- Fix memory allocation to always abort execution on failure.

===========================
1.12.0 - September 30, 2021
===========================

- This release does not contain changes over the 1.11.1 development release.

=======================
1.11.1 - August 4, 2021
=======================

- New API to handle requests initiated by web content to (un)fullscreen web
  views.
- Support building on Windows.

========================
1.9.1 - January 18, 2021
========================

- Improve the Meson build system to allow using libwpe as a subproject.

=====================
1.7.1 - July 29, 2020
=====================

- New build configuration system based on Meson. The existing CMake-based
  system is still maintained, and both produce the same outputs.
- Hidden visibility is now used by default for symbols, and only those
  belonging to the public API are exported.

=====================
1.3.1 - June 17, 2019
=====================

- Fix WebKit build issue due to usage of angle-bracketed includes, when
  WPEBackend-fdo 1.3.1 is also installed.

===================
1.3.0 - May 8, 2019
===================

- New API to set the device scaling factor. Backends and WebKit embedders
  can use this to e.g. support HiDPI displays.
- New API to to obtain the root accessibility object for a view backend.
- Fixed memory overallocation when setting pasteboard contents.

=========================
1.1.0 - December 13, 2018
=========================

- Support building libwpe on Windows.
- New API for observing and setting the view backend state.
- Added a new wpe_renderer_backend_egl_get_platform() function which can
  be used to obtain a value which can be passed to eglGetPlatformDisplay()
  and eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT().
- Marked old function names containing the "backend" word as deprecated.
  The symbols are still available, but it is encouraged to use the new
  versions, e.g. prefer wpe_get_major_version() instead of
  wpe_backend_get_major_version().
- Marked function table struct parameters passed to some API functions
  as "const".
- Fixed headers so including <wpe-egl.h> results in <wpe.h> being included
  automatically in the correct order.
- Make instantiation of backends more robust by checking the validity of
  interface pointers obtained from the backend.

=======================
1.0.0 - August 21, 2018
=======================

This release changes the API version to 0.2, and introduces the following
changes and features:

- The library is now called libwpe to avoid confusion. The WPEBackend name
  used previously seemed to indicate that the library implemented a WPE
  backend. The new libwpe name better reflects that it contains code needed
  by the WPE WebKit port.
- The libwpe library now uses the libtool versioning convention.
- Handle conversion of keysyms to Unicode inside libwpe. This allowed to
  remove he "unicode" member from keyboard event structs, and removing
  wpe_input_key_mapper/wpe_input_key_mapper_interface.
- New field in event structs to specify keyboard modifiers.
- New API for keymap and composition handling based on libxkbcommon.


====================
0.2.0 - July 9, 2018
====================

This is a backwards-compatible release, which adds the following features:

- New API to set and query the backend implementation library being used.
- New API to query the version library, both with macros at build time,
  and functions at runtime.
- Trying to use a backend implementation library which does not provide
  a "load_object" callback will produce a meaningful error instead of
  silently failing.


====================
0.1 - April 26, 2018
====================

- Initial release
