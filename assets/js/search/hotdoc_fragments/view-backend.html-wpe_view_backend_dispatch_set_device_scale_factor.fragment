The typical reason to set a value other than 1.0 (the\ndefault) is to produce output that will display at the intended physical\nsize in displays with a high density of pixels.\nOnly values from 0.05 up to 5.0 are allowed. Setting a value outside\nthis range will be ignored, and in debug builds execution will be aborted.\nFor example, a display that has a physical resolution of 3840x2160 with\na scaling factor of 2.0 will make web content behave as if the screen\nhad a size of 1920x1080, and content will be rendered at twice the size:\neach “logical” pixel will occupy four “physical” pixels (a 2x2 box) on\nthe output.\nParameters:\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.4\n\t\t\n"});
